      We caught up with the UFC Heavyweight Champion, Jon "Bones" Jones, to discuss his successful transition to the heavyweight division and his ambitions to further cement his status as the greatest of all time. "The move to heavyweight was a natural evolution for me," Jones explains. "I've always envisioned myself dominating this division, and now I'm here."
