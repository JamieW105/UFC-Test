      Even in retirement, Khabib "The Eagle" Nurmagomedov's influence looms large over the UFC Lightweight division. We spoke with the undefeated former champion about his transition to coaching, the burgeoning talent from Dagestan, and his thoughts on the current landscape of MMA. "My focus now is on my team, on guiding the next generation," Khabib shares. "It's a different kind of challenge, but equally rewarding."
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      He discusses the principles instilled by his late father, Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov, and how those continue to shape his coaching philosophy and the success of his proteges. Khabib emphasizes the importance of hard work, discipline, and humility in achieving greatness both inside and outside the octagon. "Our path is built on consistent effort and faith," he states. "We train not just for fights, but for life."
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      The interview also touches on the future of the lightweight division and whether he ever feels the urge to return. "I made my promise, and I will keep it," Khabib firmly concludes. "My fighting days are over, but my journey in this sport is far from finished."
